      "Question": "Your organisation is moving to an Agile way of work. Your project team are strongly opposed to using Agile as they have been burned using iterations, when executives used the team velocity to try and force the team to work faster instead of keeping a sustainable pace. What will you do next?",
      "A": "Add extra resources to your team to deliver faster and avoid executives getting involved.",
      "B": "Proceed with a predictive development approach, and deal with the consequences later.",
      "C": "Ask your team to work with Agile, velocity and iterations despite their hesitations.",
      "D": "Suggest the team uses flow-based scheduling, with a Kanban board for visual work.",
      "Answer": "D",
      "Reason": "Kanban is one of the largest parts of Agile approaches, aside from other major parts such as Lean, XP and Scrum. A flow-based scheduling approach does not use sprints, lifecycles or velocity but optimises deliveries based on resource capacity, and minimises waste such as context-switching and hand- offs."

      "B": "Early and frequent feedback, to ensure a common understanding of the product.",
      "C": "Daily stand-ups, to report on progress and raise blockers.",
      "D": "Reporting to executives, to ensure they are happy with your project.",
      "Answer": "D",
      "Reason": "While reporting to executives has its place when running a project, in Agile it would rather be done by including them in other Agile core practices, such as demonstrations or reviews of the product, showing the product burndown chart in the team area, and the backlog of work. All other items are Agile core practices."

      "D": "The product owner shares the updated backlog, and the team discusses it to ensure a shared understanding.",
      "Answer": "D",
      "Reason": "The product owner should share the updated backlog items and ensure the entire team has a good understanding of how to move forward."
